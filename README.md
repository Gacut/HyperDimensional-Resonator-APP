# HyperDimensional-Resonator-APP
It's an android mockup app that recreates the functions of Hyper Dimensional Resonator - An astral time traveling device.
I am not much of a front-end guy. I just wanted to fiddle with back-end stuff with this project.

It does not work like a original one, i find that a cool project to recreate it as an Android app

[Download for Android](https://github.com/Gacut/HyperDimensional-Resonator-APP/raw/master/Android%20APK/HyperDimensional%20Resonator.apk) - Be sure to turn on "Unknown sources" function in phone settings

Usage:

1. Green switch activates Witness Well
2. Wen you press Witness Well, choose a Quartz Crystal (Choosing blood is your risk)
3. Red Switch activates the Date and Time dials.
4. After you set Date and time, turn on Rubbing Plate by switching on Yellow switch
5. When you set everything on, you can start to calibrate your astral counciousness to universe frequency by pressing rubbing plate and feel the frequency - At least that's what the original does.
